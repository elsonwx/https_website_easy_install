# https_website_easy_install
one command to generate https website on Nginx.All you need to do is input your domain names and set your web directory according the terminal prompt.

### Prerequisites

- **Port 80 and port 443 have been allowed in your server's firewall rule.**

### Usage

- Step 1: install Nginx on Linux

  - Ubuntu/Debian

    ```shell
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y install nginx
    ```

  - Centos/Redhat

    ```shell
    sudo yum -y update && sudo yum -y install nginx
    ```

- Step 2: download this script

  ```shell
  wget https://git.io/vHQLm -O https_website_easy_install.bash
  ```

- Step 3: generate https website on your linux server

  ```shell
  sudo bash https_website_easy_install.bash
  ```


### Notes

- This script will set a cron task to update the certificate on the 01:01 am of the random day of every month,so you do not have to worry about the free certificate would be expired.

- If you just want to generate a http website,you can download the `http_website_easy_install.bash` instead.

  ```shell
  wget https://git.io/vQfud -O http_website_easy_install.bash
  ```

- Some cloud platform's loading balance service has a key length limit,e.g. Google Cloud loading balance only support RSA-2048.So if you want to deploy the ssl certificate on the loading balance.You can modify the key length before running this script.

  ```shell
  sed -i 's/4096/2048/g' https_website_easy_install.bash
  ```

- If you want to use chinese domain,you need to [convert chinese domain to punycode](http://www.jb51.net/article/101397.htm),then when you are asking to input the domain name by this script, just input the punycode.e.g.[https://王祥.我爱你](https://xn--qbyu8j.xn--6qq986b3xl),the punycode is `xn--qbyu8j.xn--6qq986b3xl`



### Issues

- #### SELinux cause the Nginx 403 error

  The SELinux mode may be opened in centos/redhat 6.6 and later,you will fail in the first step to establish a http website.You can check whether the SELinux is enabled in your server through execute `sestatus -v` command.this error can be solved by closing the SELinux simply,you can close the SELinux and restart your server

  ```shell
  sudo sed -i 's/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=disabled/g' /etc/selinux/config
  sudo init 6
  ```
